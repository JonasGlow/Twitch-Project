# Twitch-Project

Analysis of data of the Top100 streams on Twitch deployed as an interactive web-app. Build with Plotly Dash. <br>
Data pulled every two hours for 24 hours. Including follower count, videos, and clips for each streamer. 
Note: Streamers can occur multiple times in the whole dataset as the data from the timeslots is treated independently.
